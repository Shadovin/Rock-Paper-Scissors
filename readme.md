Game Rock, Paper, Scissors This is my first project which i made.The game is very simple, and I'm sure you have played it before.To start 
game you must to choose one of the 3 three options (rock, paper and scissors), and then click a button "Choose and play". 
On the bottom you will see your score. Moreover you will see how many games you've played, which option computer selected, 
and how many wins, draws or loses you have. Just try and have fun :)




The project is based on the course // Samuraj Programowania -"Programowanie w JavaScript".
